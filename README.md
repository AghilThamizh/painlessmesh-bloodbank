IMPLEMENTATING TREE TOPOLOGY IN ESP32 AND REDUCING LOAD IN ROUTES OF A NETWORK 

The unit which administers and manages the requisition and distribution of the blood is named as a blood bank. The main objectives of the blood banks are providing blood to the patients with minimal blood transfusion error. Blood is a very important medical supply so it should be managed well. As the blood bank management consists of several manual steps, therefore it will become difficult for the blood banks to provide a high level of accuracy, reliability, automation in blood storage and transfusion process. The system proposed is divided into three segments, the first segment consists of Temperature sensor, IR sensor nodes which is installed in rack of blood bank, and the GSM Module for sending request of blood to the donors and to blood banks so that all these are interfaced with Arduino Mega. Second segment consists of Wi-Fi module for data transfer to the server and third segment is used to display the status of available blood stock. The real-time status of blood stock of the blood bank is displayed on web page, so that the blood seekers can get the blood from their nearest blood bank.
